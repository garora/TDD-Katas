Create a Password verifications class called “PasswordVerifier”.
Add the following verifications to a master function called “Verify()”

- password should be larger than 8 chars

- password should not be null

- password should have one uppercase letter at least

- password should have one lowercase letter at least

- password should have one number at least

    Each one of these should throw an exception with a different message of your choosing

    2. Add feature: Password is OK if at least three of the previous conditions is true

    3. Add feature: password is never OK if item 1.4 is not true.

8. Assume Each verification takes 1 second to complete. How would you solve  items 2 and 3  so tests can run faster?
